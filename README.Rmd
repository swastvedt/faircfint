# faircfint

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of faircfint is to facilitate estimation and inference for intersectional, counterfactual unfairness metrics. The metrics and techniques are described in ["An intersectional framework for counterfactual fairness in risk prediction"] (https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01194) (2022).

## Installation

You can install the development version of faircfint from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("swastvedt/faircfint")
```


<!-- You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>. -->
